# SVG Generator Web App 🎨

This is the first web application I developed back in 2022 as a school project. It's a simple **SVG logo generator** built using **C#** and **ASP.NET Core**, where users can create custom SVG logos based on input parameters like text, shape, and color.

## 🚀 Features

- Generate SVG files based on user input
- Choose between different shapes (Circle, Triangle, Square)
- Customize text content and color
- Display generated SVG directly in the browser

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** C#
- **Framework:** ASP.NET Core MVC
- **IDE:** Visual Studio
- **Platform:** .NET 6

## 📂 Project Structure

- `Models/`: Contains the SVG shape logic (Circle, Triangle, Square)
- `Controllers/`: Handles form submission and logic
- `Views/`: Razor Pages for user interaction
- `Program.cs`: App entry point and configuration

## 🧠 What I Learned

- ASP.NET Core MVC fundamentals
- Razor syntax and dynamic form handling
- Basic object-oriented programming in C#
- Generating and rendering SVGs programmatically

## 🖥️ How to Run It Locally

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KurtJJensen01/Jensen_SvgGenerator.git
